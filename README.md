## Problem Statement
With large crowds and limited capacity being inconvenient for diners, how can we design an app to seamlessly allow diners to make informed decisions on where and when to eat?

## Solution
Introducing FEAST, Food Establishment Autonomous Spatial Tracking, a real-time crowd tracking app. Features F&B establishments in SUTD with up to date information on opening/closing times as well as daily specials, current crowd levels as well as historic crowd data levels.
